1. List me the stores allowed to sell alcohol
	-select name from interview.stores where allowed_alcohol is true;
	--Gettar
2. Give the product name of the 2 most expensive items based on their price at store id 1
	-select a.name, b.price from interview.products as a
		INNER JOIN
		interview.store_prices as b on a.id = b.product_id
		where b.store_id = 1
		order by b.price DESC
		limit 2
		- Golden Banana and Banana
3. List the products that are not sold in the store id 2
	- select a.name from interview.products as a
INNER JOIN
interview.store_prices as b on a.id = b.product_id 
  WHERE b.product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM interview.store_prices
    where store_id = 2
  );
  -Golden Banana and Banana
4. What is the most popular item sold?
	select a.name
  		from interview.products as a
  		inner join 
			interview.order_lines as b on a.id = b.product_id
		  	order by b.qty desc
		  	limit 1
		  	- Banana
5. Update the line_total field
	This really needs a loop, but I would personally do the loop in code and iterate through the found product_ids since product_ids is not primary and not guaranteed to have all numbers in a range.
	Example for product_id = 1:
	update interview.order_lines
  	set line_total = (select sum(qty) from interview.order_lines where product_id = 1)
  	where product_id = 1;
